## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

## üé® Styling Strategy

Tailwind CSS is integrated via CDN for rapid prototyping and minimal setup. This approach avoids build tooling while still enabling:

- Responsive layouts (`flex`, `grid`, `gap`, `space-x`);
- Theming via `dark:` options to render light or dark mode;
- Utility classes for spacing, typography, borders, and gradients;
- Shadow settings, loading animation and icons.
